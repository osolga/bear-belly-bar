BIT Student Project (FHNW Hochschule)

It is a student project made by Business Information Technology students. For non-commercial purposes.
We are thankful to W3Schools for tutorials and free templates and to Dribbble for the beautiful gifs.
All the images of beer and bears do not belong to us, they were found on the Internet.
